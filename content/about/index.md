Hi there 👋 

My name is Chenmeinian Guo「郭陈美年」. I am currently a Master's student at [NYU Courant](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/). I completed my Bachlor's degree in Computer and Information Science at [the Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu).
My primary interests lie in the fields of software development and machine learning. Beyond coding and algorithms, I enjoy playing guitar and learning about music and finance.

Eager to learn and practice guitar, but swamped with work.
