Hi there 👋 

My name is **Chenmeinian Guo 「郭陈美年」**. I'm currently a dedicated Computer Science graduate student at [NYU Courant](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/). I embarked on my academic journey in the bustling city of Shanghai where I was born and raised. After earning my Bachelor’s degree in Computer and Information Science from [the Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu) — a place far quieter than my hometown — I've returned to the vibrant energy of NYC to advance my studies.

My primary interests lie in the fields of software development and deep learning. This summer, I am excited to intern at the headquarters of [Bilibili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilibili), a top-tier video sharing platform in China. Here, I am engaging with dynamic teams to enhance media technologies that millions enjoy.

Beyond coding and algorithms, I enjoy playing guitar. Music, especially exploring different genres and blending them, fascinates me just as much as any coding puzzle. Although I'm currently striving to transcend the beginner level, my goal is to become an intermediate player who can jam confidently with friends and fellow music enthusiasts. I also have a keen interest in finance, always trying to understand more about the economic forces shaping our world. Additionally, I love traveling and recently had the chance to experience the vibrant atmosphere at the I-Days Milano during the Metallica M72 World Tour.
