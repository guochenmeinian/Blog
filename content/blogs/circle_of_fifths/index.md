### Circle of Fifths
The Circle of Fifths is more than just a diagram; it's a roadmap to the musical relationships among the 12 tones of the chromatic scale. Here's how it functions:

Key Signatures: Moving clockwise adds sharps, and counterclockwise introduces flats.
Dominant and Subdominant: The V (fifth) chord is dominant, and the IV (fourth) chord is subdominant, both crucial to harmonic tension and resolution.
Modulation: The Circle demonstrates which keys are harmonically close, aiding in smooth key transitions within compositions.

### Relative Major/Minor: Complementary Colors in Music
Every minor scale pairs with a major scale, known as its relative. Though they share the same notes, they start from different root points and invoke contrasting moods.

From Major to Minor: Descend three semitones. E.g., C Major links to A minor.
From Minor to Major: Ascend three semitones. E.g., F# minor corresponds with A major.
Transitioning between relatives can inject contrasting emotions into a piece, toggling between bright and introspective tones.


### 一些心得
五度一般不加说明的话，就是代表纯五度的音程关系。按照上图耳熟能详的C大调为例，上行五度就是G（顺时针，往右），下行五度就是F（逆时针，往左）。由于五度还有一个叫发是“属”，我们也会把上行五度音称为属音，下行五度称为下属音。

从2022年初从零开始学习电吉他以来 熟悉五度圈是我体验下来最好的学习音乐的方式 不管是对于即兴 和弦 乐理 熟悉指板 不管是对于键盘类还是弦类管类乐器的学习者 五度圈都是极佳的一项练习
