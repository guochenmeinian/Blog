ðŸ‘‹ Hello

**This blog shows chords for major and minor scales (mainly used for me to practice/memorize the scales)**

### Major Scale Chords
The major scale, often heard as the "Do-Re-Mi" progression, is uplifting and bright. When we extract chords from this scale, we get a sequence of major, minor, and diminished chords. These chords provide the backbone to most classical and popular music melodies. Played in sequence, they convey a sense of resolution, with the last chord naturally leading back to the first, completing the musical circle.

I-IV-V-I: This is one of the most basic and frequently used chord progressions. 

I-V-vi-IV: This progression is ubiquitous in pop music. (eg. [Someone like you](https://open.spotify.com/track/1zwMYTA5nlNjZxYrvBB2pV?si=10bea2ba886146eb))

ii-V-I: Common in jazz music. While many jazz standards like ["Autumn Leaves"](https://music.apple.com/us/album/autumn-leaves/724729986?i=724730318) and "All The Things You Are" feature it, they might not be "famous" in the pop sense.

I-vi-IV-V (or I-vi-II-V): Also known as the 50s progression because of its popularity during that decade. 

vi-IV-I-V: A variant of the previous progression, popular in many modern pop and rock songs. (eg. [I just called to say love you](https://open.spotify.com/track/6RNDeRnWsRMjPdNVgupZCs?si=c5d3c70f2bb44d23), [When I was your man](https://open.spotify.com/track/0nJW01T7XtvILxQgC5J7Wh?si=a006a5259dee4f99))

### Minor Scale Chords
In contrast to the major scale, the minor scale has a moodier, more introspective sound. The chords derived from this scale echo its melancholic tone. While major chords sound resolved and complete, minor chords possess a yearning quality, often evoking emotions of sadness, nostalgia, or introspection.
