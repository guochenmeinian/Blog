# Guochenmeinian's Blog

Welcome to the repository for my personal blog. This site is built using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/)'s [anemone theme](https://www.getzola.org/themes/anemone/) and is deployed using GitHub Actions and hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Quick Start

If you're interested in building a similar site, check out this [Tutorial](https://guochenmeinian.github.io/blogs/blog-tutorial/) that I've written. It guides you through the process of setting up a blog with Zola and deploying it via Netlify (free and simple).
